When approaching the design of my 3D scene, I called from past experiences and skills garnered here at SNHU in which I utilized a Scrum-Agile approach. Though I did not follow that methodology exactly, I used it as inspiration for my development process. I have found that an iterative process of development works best with my development style, so I chose to create goals for mini “sprints” to accomplish each task assigned. I began by laying out my entire scene with simple 3D shapes, and built upon my project from there, piece by piece, until I had a functioning whole. These tactics can be applied in professional settings by taking each functionality requirement one step at a time, working on building up the base for a project then adding additional functionality onto said base. The milestones laid out for us helped quite a bit with this, as each assignment gave me a clear picture of how to improve my scene for my next sprint.

I have worked with virtual 3D environments in the past, mainly in Unity, Unreal Engine, and Blender, to create video games. However, I quickly learned at the start of this course that I had no idea how vastly different 3D development would be at the base graphical level. The understanding of vertices and indices, and polygons that go into creating a basic 3D shape is very surreal coming from a 3D development standpoint where I mainly worked with complex 3D environments. I certainly have a deeper appreciation for the development of each 3D engine I’ve used in the past. Once I garnered a basic understanding of vertices and indices and how simple triangles came together to form a 3D shape, my knowledge of 3D graphics vastly improved. The great thing about computer science is how versatile it can be, meaning this knowledge of 3D graphics can not only be applied to games, but also to 3D models used in simulations, medical and scientific animations, and education. The applications are truly vast and limited only by the scope in which you choose to use them.
